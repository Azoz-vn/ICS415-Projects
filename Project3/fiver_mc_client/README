# Minecraft Clone (Voxel Game)

A voxel-based 3D game engine inspired by Minecraft, written in C++ using OpenGL for rendering. This project features basic mechanics like world generation, player movement, block interaction (placing and breaking), and raycasting for block selection.

## Features
- **Chnunk System**: Chunks are organized into a world struct.
- **Player Controls**: WASD movement, jumping, and block interactions.
- **Block Placement/Breaking**: Use the mouse to break and place blocks.
- **Raycasting**: Select blocks for interaction based on mouse position.
- **Voxel Engine**: Efficient handling of large-scale 3D worlds.
